# Terraform 
- Is a tool for building, chaging, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
- can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
- Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire data center.
- Generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and executes it to build the entire infrastructure. 
- As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans whihc can be applied. 
- The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features etc.
