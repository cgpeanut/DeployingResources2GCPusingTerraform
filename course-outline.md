Chapter 2: Overview
    why you should use terraform to manage GCP
    what is Terraform ?
        1. Is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
        2. Can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
        3. Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire data center.
        4. Generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and executes it to build the entire infrastructure. 
        5. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans whihc can be applied. 
        6. The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, load balancers, DNS entries, SaaS features like stackdriver etc.
